# 🖥️ Scanning a Windows VM: Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated

## 🎯 Objective
Compare the results of scanning a Windows 10 VM using Tenable with **unauthenticated** vs **authenticated** credentials. Understand the differences in findings, scan duration, and why authenticated scans are more valuable in a SOC context.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Azure** (for hosting the Windows 10 Virtual Machine)  
- **Tenable Vulnerability Management** (scanner)  
- **PowerShell** (to configure VM registry key)  

---

## ⚙️ Lab Setup
1. Created a Windows 10 VM in Azure  
   - Used **strong credentials**   
   - Disabled Windows Firewall for testing  
   - Applied registry key to allow remote admin access

## Scan Setup

### **Unauthenticated Scan**
- No credentials  
- Exported results  
- Scan Duration: 9 mins

### **Authenticated Scan**
- Added valid credentials  
- Exported results  
- Scan Duration: 23 mins

Deleted VM and cleaned up Azure resources

## 📝 Conclusion / Key Takeaways
- **Authenticated scans provide more detailed results** because they can access the system internally, revealing vulnerabilities that unauthenticated scans cannot.  
- **Scan duration is longer** for authenticated scans, but the extra time is worthwhile for the richer data.  
- **Unauthenticated scans are useful for external assessments** or quick checks, but they can miss critical vulnerabilities.  
- **SOC relevance:** Authenticated scans help analysts prioritize risks and respond faster because the results are more accurate and complete.  

> In practice, a combination of both scan types is often recommended: start with an unauthenticated scan for baseline insights, then perform authenticated scans for a deeper dive.
