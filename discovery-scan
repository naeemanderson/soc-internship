# üåê Discovery Scan for Entire Cyber Range Subnet

## Overview
This lab demonstrates how to perform a **Discovery Scan** in Tenable.io across a subnet range.  
Discovery scans are used to identify live hosts, open ports, and network services before deeper vulnerability scans.

---

## Steps

1. **Create New Discovery Scan**
   - In Tenable.io, go to **Scans ‚Üí New Scan**.
   - Select **Discovery** as the scan type.

2. **Configure Targets**
   - Enter the following subnet:  
     ```
     10.0.0.0/21
     ```

3. **Launch the Scan**
   - Start the scan and wait for results to populate.

4. **Review Results**
   - Observe which assets were discovered.
   - Take note of:  
     - **IP addresses**  
     - **Operating systems**  
     - **Open ports / services detected**

5. **Think About Tagging**
   - Consider how discovered assets might be grouped/tagged for future scans:  
     - By subnet  
     - By operating system  
     - By asset type (server, workstation, VM, etc.)

## Key Notes
- Discovery scans **do not perform full vulnerability checks**.  
- They are lightweight and primarily used for **asset inventory and scoping**.  
- This step is often the **first stage of vulnerability management** in a SOC workflow.  

---

## Takeaways
- Discovered assets can help scope **authenticated vs unauthenticated scans** later.  
- Tagging assets improves automation and reporting within Tenable.  
- Discovery scans reduce blind spots by showing you **what‚Äôs really on the network**.
