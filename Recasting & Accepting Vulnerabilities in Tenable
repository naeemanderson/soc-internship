# üîß Recasting & Accepting Vulnerabilities in Tenable

## Overview
This lab demonstrates how to manage vulnerabilities in **Tenable.io** by using **Recast Rules** and **Accepted Vulnerabilities**.  
These tools allow analysts to adjust the risk posture of findings without modifying the actual scan results.

## Steps

1. **Log into Tenable**  
   Navigate to [https://cloud.tenable.com](https://cloud.tenable.com) ‚Üí Vulnerability Management.

2. **Select a Scan**  
   - Go to **Scans** in the menu.  
   - Choose one of your scans that has vulnerabilities.  
   - Select **See All Details**.  

3. **Choose a Vulnerability**  
   - Select one of the findings.  
   - Copy the **PluginID** of the vulnerability.

4. **Access Settings**  
   - From the menu, click **Settings**.  
   - Under **Settings**, choose **Recast Rules**.  

5. **Add a Rule**  
   - Click **+ Add Rule** in the upper left.  
   - Configure a recast rule or accept the vulnerability based on PluginID.  
   - Save your changes.

## Key Notes
- **Recast Rules**: Change the severity (e.g., marking a *High* vuln as *Medium*).  
- **Accept Rules**: Mark a vulnerability as accepted risk (e.g., known issue that won‚Äôt be remediated).  
- Rules only apply on **future scans**. Run a re-scan to observe changes.

## Takeaways
- Recasting/accepting does not ‚Äúfix‚Äù a vulnerability, but it allows organizations to:  
  - Prioritize remediation efforts,  
  - Document risk acceptance,  
  - Prevent noise in reporting.
